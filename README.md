What is the basis for time perception and is our internal clock affected by withdrawal states? These are 2 time perception tasks based on: Brocas I, Carrillo J, Tarraso J. How long is a minute? Games Econ Behav. 2015;111. doi:10.1016/j.geb.2018.06.007


**Time production task**: This task will ask a person to produce a certain amount of time, such as clicking a mouse to begin and end a certain duration. Participants will be asked to produce 9 time intervals: 24, 31, 41, 53, 69, 89, 116, 151 and 196 seconds to be presented in random order. Subjects will be instructed not to count and will not be incentivized for correct time estimation. Subjects will mark the beginning and end of each interval by clicking on a button.  
**Time estimation task**: This task asks a person to estimate the length of time that has passed by the number of seconds a visual cue (a lightbulb) was presented for. Participants will be asked to guess the above 9 time intervals.
